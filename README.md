# Case Report
**Detective: Diego Leiva**

## Investigation Overview
This investigation focused on a series of clues that ultimately led me to identify the tailor as the murderer. Through careful analysis and diligent search of various locations, I was able to rule out other suspects and weapons, narrowing down the possible crime scene to the greenhouse.


## Evidence and Findings
- Clue 1: The first clue directed me to the gazebo, where I cleared the banker as a suspect, finding no weapon or crime scene evidence.
- Clue 2: The second clue took me to the sandbox in the park, where I found a wooden box, but ruled it out as the weapon.
- Clue 3: The third clue led me to the pond, where I cleared the carpenter, finding no weapon.
- Clue 4: At the town hall records, I discovered leather gloves, which I ruled out as the weapon. This left the letter opener as the only viable weapon.
- Clue 5: The fifth clue directed me to the greenhouse, where the pristine condition of the room and lack of evidence confirmed it as the crime scene.
- Clue 6: The sixth clue provided confirmation: the greenhouse was the crime scene, with no one present at the time of the murder. All other suspects were ruled out, and the tailor emerged as the only possible murderer. The letter opener was determined to be the weapon used in the crime.


## Final Conclusion
After a thorough investigation and the collection of key evidence, the case is now closed. The tailor is the murderer, and the letter opener was the weapon used in the crime. The crime took place in the greenhouse, and all findings point conclusively to the tailor's involvement.
