## Notes

### Updates
1. Following my first clue, I searched the park for good measure, even though it pointed directly to the gazebo. The park was empty, with no objects or evidence. At the gazebo, I found the blacksmith but no weapon or signs of the crime.
2. The second clue, found in the gazebo, led me to the sandbox in the park. I returned to the park and stopped at the playground to inspect it for good measure but found nothing. Proceeding to the sandbox, I discovered a wooden box, though no one was in sight.

### Deductions
1. The Blacksmith was cleared of involvement after finding him in the Gazebo.
2. Upon discovering the Wooden Box in the sandbox, I quickly ruled it out as the murder weapon.

### Case State
- Location: Unknown
- Killer: Unknown
- Weapon: Unknown

**Summary**
Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
