### Updates
1. Following my first clue, I searched the park for good measure, even though it pointed directly to the gazebo. The park was empty, with no objects or evidence. At the gazebo, I found the blacksmith but no weapon or signs of the crime.
2. The second clue, found in the gazebo, led me to the sandbox in the park. I returned to the park and stopped at the playground to inspect it for good measure but found nothing. Proceeding to the sandbox, I discovered a wooden box, though no one was in sight.
3. The third clue, found in the sandbox, directed me to the pond in the park. There, I found the carpenter but no weapon, ruling them out as a suspect.

### Deductions
1. The Blacksmith was cleared of involvement after finding him in the Gazebo.
2. Upon discovering the Wooden Box in the sandbox, I quickly ruled it out as the murder weapon.
3. Finding the carpenter at the pond allowed me to rule them out of involvement. This leaves only one suspect: the tailor, who is now the primary suspect and possible murderer.

### Case State
- Location: Unknown
- Killer: The Tailor (we need further evidence)
- Weapon: Unknown

**Summary**

So far, the crime location remains unidentified, though it is likely an empty area. We have not yet determined the weapon used, but we have solid evidence that the tailor is the murderer. Our next clue may help solidify this suspicion.
