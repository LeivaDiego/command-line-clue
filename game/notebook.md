### Updates
1. Following my first clue, I searched the park for good measure, even though it pointed directly to the gazebo. The park was empty, with no objects or evidence. At the gazebo, I found the blacksmith but no weapon or signs of the crime.
2. The second clue, found in the gazebo, led me to the sandbox in the park. I returned to the park and stopped at the playground to inspect it for good measure but found nothing. Proceeding to the sandbox, I discovered a wooden box, though no one was in sight.
3. The third clue, found in the sandbox, directed me to the pond in the park. There, I found the carpenter but no weapon, ruling them out as a suspect.
4. The fourth clue led me to the town hall records. After checking the town hall and offices with no relevant findings, I focused on the records. I found leather gloves, which I ruled out as the weapon.
5. The fifth clue led me to the greenhouse in the houses area. I searched the houses and cottage, finding the banker but no relevant information. I then searched the mansion, but found nothing. Finally, in the garden, I found the greenhouse. After searching it, there was only the empty room, theres only one thing left to do, check the sixth clue in there.


### Deductions
1. The Blacksmith was cleared of involvement after finding him in the Gazebo.
2. Upon discovering the Wooden Box in the sandbox, I quickly ruled it out as the murder weapon.
3. Finding the carpenter at the pond allowed me to rule them out of involvement. This leaves only one suspect: the tailor, who is now the primary suspect and possible murderer.
4. Finding the gloves rules them out as the weapon, leaving the letter opener as the only possible murder weapon.
5. The greenhouse was likely the crime scene, as it was empty and the previous clue led me there.


### Case State
- Location: Greenhouse (need more evidence)
- Killer: The Tailor (need more evidence)
- Weapon: Letter Opener (need more evidence)


**Summary**

The crime location remains an empty area, most likely the greenhouse given the evidence. The weapon used is now most likely to be a letter opener, and the only remaining suspect is the tailor. All other leads and suspects have been ruled out. Further clues may help confirm this deduction.
