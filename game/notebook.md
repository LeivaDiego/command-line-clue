### Updates
1. Following my first clue, I searched the park for good measure, even though it pointed directly to the gazebo. The park was empty, with no objects or evidence. At the gazebo, I found the blacksmith but no weapon or signs of the crime.

### Deductions
1. The Blacksmith was cleared of involvement after finfing him in the Gazebo.

### Case State
- Location: Unknown
- Killer: Unknown
- Weapon: Unknown

**Summary**
Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
