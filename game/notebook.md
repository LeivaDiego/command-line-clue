### Updates
1. Following my first clue, I searched the park for good measure, even though it pointed directly to the gazebo. The park was empty, with no objects or evidence. At the gazebo, I found the blacksmith but no weapon or signs of the crime.
2. The second clue, found in the gazebo, led me to the sandbox in the park. I returned to the park and stopped at the playground to inspect it for good measure but found nothing. Proceeding to the sandbox, I discovered a wooden box, though no one was in sight.
3. The third clue, found in the sandbox, directed me to the pond in the park. There, I found the carpenter but no weapon, ruling them out as a suspect.
4. The fourth clue led me to the town hall records. After checking the town hall and offices with no relevant findings, I focused on the records. I found leather gloves, which I ruled out as the weapon.

### Deductions
1. The Blacksmith was cleared of involvement after finding him in the Gazebo.
2. Upon discovering the Wooden Box in the sandbox, I quickly ruled it out as the murder weapon.
3. Finding the carpenter at the pond allowed me to rule them out of involvement. This leaves only one suspect: the tailor, who is now the primary suspect and possible murderer.
4. Finding the gloves rules them out as the weapon, leaving the letter opener as the only possible murder weapon.

### Case State
- Location: Unknown
- Killer: The Tailor (need more evidence)
- Weapon: Letter Opener (need more evidence)

**Summary**

The crime location remains unidentified, but it is likely an empty area. The weapon used has not been determined, though the only possibility left is a letter opener. All other suspects have been cleared, and the evidence strongly points to the tailor as the murderer. Further clues may help confirm our findings.
